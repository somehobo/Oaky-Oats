Create and View climbing routes on home gym walls
Used this idea as a guide for learning more about swift and xcode with the extra time during quarantine!


Front page of the app is a picture of the wall me and my friends built:

The homepage acts as a list of the routes that people have created on the app. The plan was to create another level of walls that the routes belong to
however the need for this app declined because other climbing gyms opened up
